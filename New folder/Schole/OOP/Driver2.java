/*simple exercise regarding (sequential, conditional,repetitive and simple I/O
        Your task:
            simulate a simple robot named Robby
            Robby is a robot that could move based on a given direction (N,E,W,S) and distance (n>0)
            Create a menu driven program that instructs Robby to move
            
            [1] Location
            [2] Move

            Robby is located at the origin (0,0)
            Enter your choice >> 2
            Enter direction (N,E,W,S) >> N
            Enter distance (n>0) >> 10
            Robby moved North, 10 units
            Enter your choice >> 1
            Robby is located at (0,10)
            Enter your choice >> 2
            Enter direction (N,E,W,S) >> E
            Enter distance (n>0) >> 10
            Robby is located at (10,10)
            Enter your choice >> 3
            Robby reset at (0,0)
